### Hello, Im Graphite!
I do programming and play videogames.

I have a bunch of projects of mine on this GitHub account but also a bunch in private/off-platform repos, 
so feel free to look around :). (Keep in mind that most aren't documented properly)

Im "proficient" in C(++), Javascript and Python although I can use other languages as well.

Here are some quick facts you might wish to know about me:
* Age: 15
* Pronouns: He/Him
* Favourite videogame: TF2

Do not mind the bareness of this page as it's only here in case im redesigning my website (which happens quite often).
